                    \ your doctor. Read all information given to you. Follow all instructions\
                    \ closely. Follow how to use as you have been told by the doctor\
                    \ or read the package insert. To gain the most benefit, do not\
                    \ miss doses. Keep using this drug as you have been told by your\
                    \ doctor or other health care provider, even if you feel well.\
                    \ Use this drug at the same time of day. For breathing in only.\
                    \ Do not prepare a dose until you need to take it. If you prepare\
                    \ a dose and close the inhaler without taking a dose, it will\
                    \ waste the drug and may damage the inhaler. Do not breathe out\
                    \ into the puffer (inhaler). Close the inhaler after you use your\
                    \ dose. Do not take the device apart or wash it. Do not use it\
                    \ with a spacer. Do not breathe out into the device. Clean mouthpiece\
                    \ by wiping with a dry tissue or cloth. Do not wash or put in\
                    \ water. This inhaler has a dose counter to keep track of how\
                    \ many doses are left. Throw away the inhaler when you have been\
                    \ told after opening or when the dose counter has a 0 in it, whichever\
                    \ comes first. Have your puffer (inhaler) use checked with your\
                    \ doctor at each visit. Read and follow facts on how to use the\
                    \ puffer. Make sure you use the puffer the right way. Rinse out\
                    \ mouth after each use. Do not swallow the rinse water. Spit it\
                    \ out. If using more than 1 type of puffer (inhaler), ask the\
                    \ doctor which puffer to use first. HOW DO I STORE AND/OR THROW\
                    \ OUT THIS DRUG? Store at room temperature. Store in foil pouch\
                    \ until ready for use. Protect from heat and sunlight. Store in\
                    \ a dry place. Do not store in a bathroom. Keep all drugs in a\
                    \ safe place. Keep all drugs out of the reach of children and\
